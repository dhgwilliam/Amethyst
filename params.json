{"name":"Amethyst","tagline":"Tiling window manager for OS X.","body":"Amethyst\r\n========\r\n\r\nTiling window manager for OS X similar to xmonad. Was originally written as an\r\nalternative to [fjolnir's](https://github.com/fjolnir) awesome\r\n[xnomad](https://github.com/fjolnir/xnomad) but written in pure\r\nObjective-C. It's expanded to include some more features like Spaces support not\r\nreliant on fragile private APIs.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCredit goes to [fjolnir](https://github.com/fjolnir) for the bulk of the initial\r\nlogic and structure.\r\n\r\nUsing Amethyst\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThe `Enable access for assistive devices` option on the Accessibility\r\npreferences pane must be enabled for Amethyst to function.\r\n\r\n![Enable access for assistive devices](https://raw.github.com/ianyh/Amethyst/gh-pages/images/accessibility-window.png)\r\n\r\nKeyboard Shortcuts\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nAmethyst uses three modifier combinations.\r\n\r\n* `mod1` - `option + shift`\r\n* `mod2` - `ctrl + option + shift`\r\n* `mod3` - `ctrl + option`\r\n\r\nAnd defines the following commands.\r\n\r\n* `mod1 + space` â€” change layout\r\n* `mod1 + [n]` - focus the nth screen\r\n* `mod2 + [n]` - move focused window to nth screen\r\n* `mod3 + [n]` - move focused window to nth space\r\n* `mod1 + h` - shrink the main pane\r\n* `mod1 + l` - expand the main pane\r\n* `mod1 + ,` - increase the number of windows in the main pane\r\n* `mod1 + .` - decrease the number of windows in the main pane\r\n* `mod1 + j` - focus the next window counterclockwise\r\n* `mod1 + k` - focus the next window clockwise\r\n* `mod2 + j` - move the focused window one space counterclockwise\r\n* `mod2 + k` - move the focused window one space clockwise\r\n* `mod1 + return` - swap the focused window with the main window\r\n\r\nSetting Up Spaces Support\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nSpaces are, unfortunately, not supported right out of the box. To enable it you\r\nmust activate Mission Control's keyboard shortcuts for switching to specific\r\nDesktops, as Mac OS X calls them. This option is in the Keyboard Shortcuts tab\r\nof the Keyboard preferences pane. The shortcuts will be of the form `ctrl +\r\n[n]`. Amethyst is only able to send a window to the `n`th space if the shortcut\r\n`ctrl + n` is enabled.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
